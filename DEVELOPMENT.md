<h2>Revolutionary Renderer Development Log:</h2>
* 11/15/19 - Generated project, added openFrameworks ofxGui and ofxVectorGraphics, learned how to draw simple 2d shapes and change colors.
* 11/16/19 - Began basic perspective rendering by displaying the vertices of a cube. Added camera movement with wsad/space/shift and camera rotation with arrow keys.
* 11/18/19 - Fixed camera movement to be relative to view angle, added ability to control the camera with the mouse, began using lines to render edges

**Upcoming:**

* Remove strange effect where points and lines out of view appear on screen and distorted
* Restrict the user's vertical view angle to keep them from turning upside down
* Possibly consolidate camera behavior into a Camera class
* Switch to only drawing edges
