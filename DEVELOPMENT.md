<h2>Revolutionary Renderer Development Log:</h2>

* 11/15/19 - Generated project, added openFrameworks ofxGui and ofxVectorGraphics, learned how to draw simple 2d shapes and change colors.

* 11/16/19 - Began basic perspective rendering by displaying the vertices of a cube. Added camera movement with wsad/space/shift and camera rotation with arrow keys.

**Upcoming:**

* Fix camera movement to be relative to view direction
* Remove strange effect where off-screen points are rendered upside-down
* Possibly consolidate camera behavior into a Camera class
* Switch from drawing vertices to edges
