# **Revolutionary Renderer**

## Overview

*Revolutionary Renderer* is a 3D wireframe graphics renderer that can view and manipulate 3D models, as well as run simple physics simulations.

## Installation

* Use the openFrameworks project generator and Visual Studio 2019 to compile the project. The project requires openFrameworks and the addons ofxGui, ofxOpenCv, and [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv). To build the project in Visual Studio, you may need to remove autogenerated "ofApp.h" and "ofApp.cpp" files, since I instead use "renderer.h" and "renderer.cpp", which are already included in the project.

## Demos

The program includes lots of fun features and focuses most of them into three demonstration modes showing off its capabilities:

* The "Model" demo - an open 3D space in which a user can import and manipulate models in the .OBJ file format. The program comes with nine simple models, found in the `models` folder. Documentation for the source of each one can be found in the first lines of each OBJ file.
* The "Planets" demo - an sandbox environment for simulating planetary orbits. Includes a graphical interface for creating new planets.
* The "Box" demo - a demonstration of the renderer's collision simulation, featuring a box filled with bouncing balls. Includes an graphical interface for changing the size of the box and number of balls.

## Extra Features

* Ability to manipulate objects in the scene with the mouse
* Head-tracking controlled camera
* Walk Mode - allowing the user to walk around on the floor and jump with the spacebar
* On-screen display showing frame rate, frame time, and other program variables
* Toggleable floor

## Dependencies

- A moderately-powerful computer. See warning below.
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/)
- openFrameworks addons ofxGui, ofxOpenCv (both included with openFrameworks), and [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)

## Warnings

- **This project was created and tested on a laptop with a Intel i7 9750H and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU, and while it could reach a consistent 144fps in most of the medium-cost simulations and medium-poly models during development, I CANNOT GUARANTEE that this program will run smoothly on all devices. The program does its best to keep movement and physics simulations independent of framerate, but it's not without it's errors if it slows down.**
